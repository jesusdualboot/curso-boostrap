# Boostrap UI Challenge

For this challenge you will need to use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/) classes and components to build the following responsive layout.

<img src="./images/demo.png" alt="demo"  width="800px"/>

**This layout contains:**

1. A heading section.
2. A hero section.
3. A main section with a list of 9 responsive cards.
4. A footer section.

**Suggestions:**

- You can use random images from [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/) like this: https://picsum.photos/420/225?v=1, https://picsum.photos/420/225?v=2.
- You can start from this seed project which already has the Bootstrap libraries imported.

# What's expected

1. The header should be responsive. This means that on smaller screens, the menu options should collapse. _Suggestion: You can use Bootstrap’s [Navbarv component](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components/navbar/)._

<img src="./images/responsive-header.png" width="400px"/>
<img src="./images/responsive-header-open.png" width="400px"/>

2. Cards should arrange responsively. This means that their layout has to change according to the screen size.
   - For _xs_ there should be 1 card per row, for _sm_ 2 and for _md and bigger_ 3.

<img src="./images/xl-cards.png" width="800px"/>
<img src="./images/md-cards.png" width="800px"/>
<img src="./images/xs-cards.png" width="400px"/>

# Objective

The purpose of this challenge is for you to practice your Bootstrap skills by creating a real UI. Please note that there is no right or wrong way to solve this. What we want to see is how you can solve this responsive layout just by using Bootstrap classes. Please try not to use any custom classes. Have fun playing with Bootstrap!
